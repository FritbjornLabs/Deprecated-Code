White Paper, Terms of Use, and Privacy Policy
**NOTICE** Following a new development the SRE (Sovereign Rune Swap) will be cancelled as well as all future Rune Token deployments and instead I will embed game mechanics so instead of minting new tokens the game itself will store necessary information. This means that there will be no internal swap or DEX feature of the game, it is no longer needed.

— Ritualized Sovereignty, Sacred Utility, and Ceremonial Exchange

📜 INTRODUCTION
Fritbjörn Labs is a mythic forge of ritual economics, ceremonial game design, and sovereign liquidity. We do not merely launch tokens—we summon runes. Each asset is imbued with symbolic power, gameplay function, and lore-bound exclusivity. They are not speculative instruments. They are ritual tools.

🪄 RUNE TOKENS — LAB EXCLUSIVE

**10/20/25 UPDATE NOTICE** No rune tokens will be minted since the SRE DEX development has been terminated. The gaming mechanics no longer requires individual runes to be minted.

🔒 Token Utility & Legal Disclaimer
The tokens issued by Fritbjörn Labs—including but not limited to FRIT, ALGIZ, FOF, and NSTANG—are not investment vehicles. They do not represent ownership, equity, or any claim to profits, dividends, or governance rights within Fritbjörn Labs or its affiliated systems.

These tokens are purely ceremonial in nature. Their sole function is to serve as keys to gameplay, unlocking access to ritual games, rune casting, and other mythic experiences curated by the Lab. They are not designed for speculative trading, financial gain, or resale.

Participation in any ritual, swap, or claim event is voluntary and symbolic, and should not be interpreted as a financial transaction or investment.

🛡️ SOVEREIGN PHILOSOPHY
The LAB is not a clone. It is a sovereign interface, hand-coded and ritualized to reject centralized gatekeeping. We do not submit to aggregator standards. We do not chase logo visibility. Every swap, every pool, every rune is under our control. This is a sacred space for mythic builders and ceremonial participants.

🔐 SECURITY & TRANSPARENCY
All liquidity pools are managed with offline keys and direct injections. We do not rely on automated flows or third-party APIs. Every transaction is logged, every ritual recorded. We maintain transparency through ceremonial announcements and mythic release notes. Our community is not an audience—it is a fellowship.

🎮 FUTURE GAME INTEGRATION
RUNE TOKENS will unlock gameplay mechanics, randomized rewards, and leaderboard modifiers. They will be used in puzzle casting, ritual staking, and ceremonial competitions. Each rune will carry unique properties and may evolve through gameplay. The LAB will serve as the gateway to these experiences.

📣 COMMUNITY & MYTHOS
Fritbjörn Labs is built on lore, not hype. We ritualize every launch, every fix, every milestone. Our announcements are ceremonial scrolls. Our giveaways are sacred offerings. We do not chase trends—we build legends.

🧾 TERMS OF USE
By interacting with the LAB, you acknowledge that RUNE TOKENS are not financial instruments. They are ceremonial assets with gameplay utility. You agree to participate in the mythos in good faith and understand that all swaps are final and sovereign.

🔐 PRIVACY POLICY
We do not harvest data. We do not track wallets. We do not sell rituals. Your interaction with the LAB is sacred and anonymous. We maintain minimal logs for security and lore continuity only.

GAME MECHANICS

Fritbjörn Labs does not offer financial products, investment advice, or profit guarantees.

🜂 THE LIVING WHITE PAPER OF FRITHLIGHT
Welcome, Runeholder. You now stand within the mythic perimeter of Fritbjörn Labs, where ritual games unfold, tokens awaken, and ceremonies bind us in shared fate.

Fritbjorn Labs tokes are not financial instruments even when market value attributes value to the token, value and return are not guaranteed. They are ceremonial tokens, vessels of participation, and a key to ritual engagement. They may be traded, gifted, or invoked—but it is not designed for speculation, investment, or profit. No guarantees are made regarding liquidity, value, or future utility. All who enter this rite do so with eyes open and runes drawn.

FRITH Ultra, Rune Casting games, The Well of Algiz, and other games or learning materials are ceremonial constructs. They are governed by odds, logic, and lore—not by financial return. All mechanics are transparent, logged, and subject to recalibration as the myth evolves.

You are responsible for your own participation. Fritbjörn Labs does not offer financial advice, nor does it solicit investment. We are mythmakers, not market-makers.

⚖️ RITUAL TERMS OF ENGAGEMENT
By invoking the Fritbjorn Lab Token Suite, accessing our site, or participating in any ceremonial game, you agree to the following terms:

Eligibility
You must be of legal age in your jurisdiction to participate. Rituals are void where prohibited by law.

Ceremonial Participation
All games, puzzles, and disbursements are offered as lore-driven experiences. No purchase is necessary to engage. Odds and mechanics are disclosed where applicable.

Limitation of Liability
Fritbjörn Labs is not liable for smart contract errors, exchange volatility, or user missteps. Participation is at your own risk. We do not guarantee uptime, token value, or prize delivery beyond what is transparently logged and ritualized.

Modification Clause
These terms may evolve without prior notice. Continued participation implies acceptance of the latest version. All changes will be marked by ceremonial announcement.

Intellectual Property
All content, lore, and mechanics are the property of Fritbjörn Labs unless otherwise noted. You may not reproduce, remix, or redistribute our rituals without explicit permission.

Jurisdiction
These rites are governed by the laws of the jurisdiction in which Fritbjörn Labs is registered. Disputes shall be resolved through ceremonial mediation or binding arbitration, as determined by the Rune Council.

🜄 Liquidity Provider Disclosure Scroll
Welcome, Runeholder. You now stand at the threshold of the Fritbjorn Lab liquidity pools—where tokens flow, odds awaken, and ritual infrastructure is forged.

By providing liquidity to any Fritbjorn Lab Token Suite trading pair (e.g., Fritbjorn Labs Utility /WPOL) on decentralized exchanges such as QuickSwap, Uniswap or others, you accept the following ceremonial terms and legal realities:

⚖️ Ritual Risk & Responsibility
Voluntary Invocation – You provide liquidity of your own volition. Fritbjörn Labs does not compel, incentivize, or guarantee returns. All acts of liquidity are ceremonial contributions to the mythic ecosystem.
No Guarantees – There is no promise of profit, stability, or restitution. Impermanent loss, slippage, and pool imbalance are inherent risks. You accept these as part of the rite.
Experimental Infrastructure – The Fritbjorn Lab Token Suite pools are evolving constructs. Smart contracts may be updated, recalibrated, or deprecated. Bugs may occur. By participating, you accept the experimental nature of the ritual.
Fritbjörn Labs provides basic liquidity by listing tokens at a lab-determined lowest price, without adding cash. The lab will never contribute USDC or other assets to liquidity pools. In DeFi, others may add liquidity below or supplement with coin, but the lab’s position is symbolic, non-financial, and fixed.
🧾 Legal & Tax Considerations
Not a Security – Fritbjorn Lab Token Suite is not designed or marketed as a security. It is a ceremonial token used for gameplay, lore, and ritual engagement. However, regulatory interpretations may vary. You are responsible for compliance in your jurisdiction.
Taxable Events – Fees earned, LP token redemptions, and pool exits may trigger taxable events. You are responsible for tracking and reporting your activity. Fritbjörn Labs does not provide tax advice.
No Custody or KYC – Fritbjörn Labs does not custody your assets, nor does it require KYC. However, third-party platforms (e.g., Telegram bots, APIs) may collect data. See our Privacy Scroll for details.
🛡️ Community Care & Flash Crash Response
On 09/03/2025, a sudden liquidity disruption occurred. While the cause remains under review, Fritbjörn Labs has opened a ceremonial support channel for affected participants. If you believe your trade or pool position was impacted, you may submit a claim for review. Restitution is not guaranteed, but ritual care will be offered where appropriate. (Offering for reimbursement ended on 09/15).

🜄 Curse Rune Blessing Event Terms (Halloween 2025)
##NOTICE## Drawing will be cancelled or delayed due to low participation and multiple wallet exploits identified.

On October 31, 2025, Fritbjörn Labs will conduct a ceremonial token blessing for eligible holders of NIDSTANG (Curse Rune). This event is governed by the following terms:

Eligibility: Wallets holding ≥1,000,000 NSTANG at the time of snapshot (October 31, 2025) will be eligible to receive matched tokens and ritual gifts.

Blessing Rewards: Ceremonial tokens will be distributed across the Fritbjörn Labs Token Suite, including Fritbjorn Labs Utility and NSTANG.
Matching Mechanic: All eligible NSTANG holdings will be matched 1:1. This is a ceremonial doubling, not a financial incentive.
No Purchase Required: Participation is free. Holding NSTANG is one method of entry, but not the only path. Additional tokens may be distributed via social quests and ceremonial drops.
Odds & Fairness: Holding more than 1M NSTANG does not increase your chances. All eligible wallets are treated equally.
Tax & Compliance: Participants are responsible for any applicable taxes. Fritbjörn Labs does not provide financial or tax advice.
Void Where Prohibited: This ritual is offered as a lore-based experience and is void where prohibited by law.
Cut off for entry is 10/30/2025

If fewer than 5 holders qualify the drawing will be delayed or cancelled. No drawing will take place if there are fewer than 5 qualifying wallets / holders.
By participating in this event, you acknowledge that it is a mythic rite, not a contest, investment, or financial transaction. All mechanics are logged and subject to recalibration as the myth evolves.

Rune Rewards Distribution, All ceremonial winnings, prize draws, Refunds and ritual game outcomes shall be paid out on a monthly basis. Payouts will be issued in the form of Polygon-based transfers to the wallet addresses associated with each winning runeholder.

Distribution occurs within the first 14 days of each calendar month, unless otherwise ritualized or delayed due to technical or ceremonial constraints.

Participants are responsible for maintaining an active wallet and ensuring receipt of their rune rewards. Fritbjörn Labs shall not be liable for missed payouts due to incorrect wallet information or inactivity.

📜 Ritual Update: Token Buyback

As of today, we begin the Buyback Ritual, rolled out in phases:

(Update: ALGIZ and all future RUNEs have been reclassified as Lab only and will NOT be available to trade on public DEXs other than Fritbjorn Lab Swap)

This ritual involves:

A. Reclaiming gifted tokens by purchasing them directly from market supply

B. Recovering oversold tokens to repurpose as liquidity anchors or ceremonial prizes

The Rune of Return has been cast. The circle tightens. Let the buyback begin.

Legal Disclosure for Fritbjörn Labs Internal Swap
Purpose
This internal Swap is operated solely for laboratory, testing, governance, and internal utility purposes for tokens described in the Fritbjörn Labs white paper and related project documentation. The Swap is not offered as a public trading venue and is intended to facilitate internal development, liquidity testing, protocol experiments, and community ritual mechanics.

Scope of Tokens
This Swap supports only internal lab tokens listed in the white paper and any additional tokens explicitly approved by Fritbjörn Labs’ governance process. Tokens available on the Swap may include prototype tokens, testnet equivalents, placeholders, governance tokens, and utility tokens used for internal ceremonies and experiments.

No Investment Advice and No Securities Representation
Use of the Swap and any token available through it does not constitute investment advice, an offer to sell, or a solicitation to buy securities. Fritbjörn Labs does not represent or guarantee that any token is a security, commodity, currency, or any other regulated financial instrument. Users should not assume any token confers ownership, profit rights, dividends, or fiduciary protections unless explicitly documented in separate, formal legal agreements.

Risk Acknowledgement
Users engaging with the Swap accept and assume all risks associated with blockchain interactions, including but not limited to smart contract bugs, protocol vulnerabilities, impermanent loss, front-running, transaction failures, network congestion, private key compromise, wallet integration risks, and total loss of token value. Internal tokens may have limited or no market liquidity and may be unusable outside Fritbjörn Labs’ environments.

Regulatory Compliance and Uncertainty
Regulatory classifications and requirements for digital assets and decentralized platforms are evolving. Fritbjörn Labs does not guarantee that the Swap or tokens will comply with current or future laws, securities regulations, tax rules, or other governmental requirements in any jurisdiction. Users are solely responsible for determining and complying with applicable laws, regulations, and tax obligations in their jurisdiction before interacting with the Swap.

Security and Operational Limitations
The Swap is provided “as is” for internal use. Fritbjörn Labs may pause, limit, modify, or terminate access to the Swap and supported tokens at any time to protect users, address security incidents, or pursue protocol updates. Fritbjörn Labs does not custody user funds and cannot reverse on-chain transactions. Users must verify contract addresses, wallet addresses, and transaction details independently before executing transactions.

Liability and Indemnification
To the fullest extent permitted by law, Fritbjörn Labs, its officers, employees, contributors, and affiliates disclaim all liability for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, special, or exemplary damages arising from use, inability to use, or reliance on the Swap or any token available through it. Users agree to indemnify and hold harmless Fritbjörn Labs against claims, losses, liabilities, expenses, and costs arising from their use of the Swap or violations of this disclosure.

Governance, Changes, and Amendments
Fritbjörn Labs reserves the unilateral right to update token lists, smart contract implementations, operational rules, and this legal disclosure at any time. Material changes affecting token utility or user rights will be communicated through official Fritbjörn Labs channels according to the governance procedures described in project documentation.

No Third-Party Endorsement
Inclusion of a token on the internal Swap does not imply endorsement, audit, or security certification by Fritbjörn Labs. External audits, third-party attestations, and security reviews may be performed at Fritbjörn Labs’ discretion and are not guaranteed.

User Responsibility and Contact
Users are responsible for their own due diligence, security practices, and compliance. For internal governance inquiries, operational questions, or to report security issues, contact the Fritbjörn Labs operations channel as specified in internal documentation.

Legal Advice and Further Guidance
This disclosure is informational only and does not constitute legal, tax, or financial advice. Consult a licensed attorney, tax advisor, or compliance professional for advice tailored to your specific circumstances.

🛡️ Eligibility, Disqualification, and Traceability Clause
To uphold the sanctity of all ceremonial drawings and ensure statistical legitimacy:

Fraudulent Behavior: Any participant found engaging in fraudulent activity—including wallet spoofing, multi-entry manipulation, bot-driven participation, or collusion—will be immediately disqualified from all current and future drawings. Fritbjörn Labs reserves the right to audit wallet activity and transaction history to preserve ritual integrity.
Illegal Activity: Participation must comply with all applicable laws. Wallets linked to financial crimes, regulatory violations, or other illegal activity will be disqualified and may be reported to appropriate authorities.
Cheating and Exploits: Use of unauthorized scripts, exploits, or manipulation of game mechanics to gain unfair advantage will result in disqualification and ceremonial banishment.
Minimum Wallet Threshold: Each drawing requires a minimum of five (5) qualifying wallets to proceed. This ensures statistical fairness, ritual balance, and meaningful distribution. If fewer than five eligible wallets are confirmed, the drawing may be postponed, canceled, or restructured at the discretion of Fritbjörn Labs.
Technical Traceability: For security and audit purposes, IP addresses, MAC addresses, and device fingerprints may be recorded during participation. This data is used solely to verify authenticity, detect manipulation, and uphold the integrity of ritual events.
🜄FINAL INVOCATION
By casting runes in this circle, you accept the terms of the rite. May your holdings be true, your runes aligned, and your fate revealed.

Terminology Clarification: Any prior use of the term “lottery” was unintentional and refers to a sweepstakes-style ceremonial blessing with no purchase required. All mechanics are designed to comply with applicable promotional laws and are framed as symbolic, lore-based experiences.
